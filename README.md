### Filtering UFO Data
The website includes 5 filters. 
Shape and Country are filtered by dropdown list due to their limited choices.
The rest are filtered by text input.
Date includes an example to show the format of date that is required.
State can accept lower or uppercase entries.
City warns that spelling must be exact. 


### With more time...
I could add further error correction or responses to warn when an input is not valid.
The dropdown list of shapes could be dynamically populated from the data using D3.
